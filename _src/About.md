# About me

Welcome to my blog! My name is Mike Delmonaco and I am a software developer with an interest in programming languages. I write about concepts I find interesting and some of my projects.

You can find the source code for most of my projects [on my GitHub](https://github.com/quasarbright) and you can email me at [mdelmonacochs@gmail.com](mailto:mdelmonacochs@gmail.com).
