# About me

Welcome to my blog! My name is Mike Delmonaco and I am a software developer with an interest in programming languages. I write about concepts I find interesting and some of my projects.

One of my goals in writing this blog is to make programming language theory more accessible. There are a lot of really cool ideas, but they mostly just exist in papers, which aren't very fun to read. To make it easier to discover and learn about these cool ideas, I want to create the explanations and tutorials that I wish I had when I was first trying to learn this stuff.

You can find the source code for most of my projects (including this blog) [on my GitHub](https://github.com/quasarbright) and you can email me at [mdelmonacochs@gmail.com](mailto:mdelmonacochs@gmail.com).
