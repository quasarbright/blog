# to do
* figure out how to do inline non-racket code in scribble. [this may be useful](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog/issues/91)
* instead of preview.sh, figure out watcher mode. [current-rebuild?](https://docs.racket-lang.org/frog/parameters.html#%28def._%28%28lib._frog%2Fparams..rkt%29._current-rebuild~3f%29%29)
# done
* make inline code look nicer by adding a gray background.
* unlisted tag like draft. doesn't show up on index, but is accessible at its url. also can't see all unlisted posts like normal tags lol.
  * it exists, it's called UNLINKED
